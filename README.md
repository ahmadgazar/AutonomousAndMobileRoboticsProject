# AutonomousAndMobileRoboticsProject

we study a pursuit-evasion problem between two humanoid robots: the pursuer and the evader. The goal of the pursuer robot is to track and reach the evader robot
that, on the other hand, should avoid any obstacle that enters its safety area. The evader should plan and execute an evasive
motion that should be continuously updated since the pursuer changes its approaching direction (to reach the evader). The
reaction time of the evasive motion should be kept as small as possible in order to avoid collisions. All the computations
needed for generating the evasive motion are computed in real- time, thanks to closed-form expressions. The problem is firstly
faced for unicycle models, proposing control laws for both the pursuer and the evader.
